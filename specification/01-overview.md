# Furcate Protocol Overview

## Abstract

Furcate is a distributed machine learning protocol enabling AI capabilities on edge devices through federated learning, ensemble methods, and cryptographic verification. Designed for industrial IoT, smart cities, precision agriculture, and autonomous systems.

## Design Goals

1. **Privacy-Preserving**: Data remains on-device
2. **Verifiable**: Cryptographic attestation of computations
3. **Compatible**: Works with legacy industrial protocols
4. **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
5. **Efficient**: Optimized for resource-constrained devices

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Application Layer
Developer-facing APIs for model deployment and inference

### 2. Coordination Layer  
Manages federated learning rounds and device orchestration

### 3. Security Layer
TEE execution, attestation, and privacy mechanisms

### 4. Transport Layer
Protocol adapters for MQTT, Modbus, OPC-UA, etc.

## Key Components

- **Edge Devices**: Run local training and inference
- **Coordinators**: Aggregate model updates (can be distributed)
- **Validators**: Proof of Authority consensus nodes
- **Protocol Bridges**: Legacy system integration

## Deployment Models

1. **Pure Edge**: No cloud dependency, fully local
2. **Hybrid**: Edge + optional cloud for analytics
3. **Federated**: Multiple organizations collaborating

See subsequent specification documents for detailed technical design.
