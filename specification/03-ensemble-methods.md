# Ensemble Learning in Furcate

## Overview

Furcate uses ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple specialized models across the edge network, improving accuracy and resilience.

## Architecture

### Model Diversity
- Temporal models: Different training windows
- Spatial models: Different geographic regions
- Architectural models: Different network architectures
- Data models: Different feature sets

## Aggregation Strategies

### Weighted Voting
Models vote with weights based on:
- Historical accuracy
- Data quality
- Model freshness
- Computational cost

### Stacking
Meta-learner combines base model predictions

### Boosting
Sequential training with error correction

## Implementation

```protobuf
message EnsemblePrediction {
  repeated ModelPrediction predictions = 1;
  float aggregated_result = 2;
  repeated float weights = 3;
  string aggregation_method = 4;
}
```

## Benefits

- Higher accuracy than single models
- Robustness to individual model failures
- Adaptability to local data distributions
- Fault tolerance in distributed systems
