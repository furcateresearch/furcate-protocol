# Furcate Protocol Specification

**Version 1.0** | October 19, 2025

A distributed machine learning protocol for edge networks enabling AI capabilities on existing infrastructure through federated learning, ensemble methods, and cryptographic verification.

## Overview

Furcate is designed for privacy-preserving, verifiable machine learning at the network edge. The protocol enables collaborative intelligence across heterogeneous devices without centralizing sensitive data, using Proof of Authority consensus among verified edge devices.

## Core Principles

### 1. Privacy-First Design
- Raw data never leaves edge devices
- Only encrypted model updates are transmitted
- Differential privacy for statistical guarantees
- Secure multi-party computation for aggregation

### 2. Verifiable Execution
- Cryptographic attestation of computations
- Hardware-backed security (TEEs)
- Proof of Authority consensus
- Tamper-evident audit trails

### 3. Legacy Compatibility
- Native support for industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC-UA, MQTT)
- No hardware replacement required
- Gradual deployment capability
- Backwards compatibility

### 4. Decentralized Architecture
- No single point of failure
- Peer-to-peer model updates
- Edge-first with optional cloud integration
- Resilient to network partitions

## Protocol Layers

### Application Layer
High-level ML operations abstracted for developers:
- Model deployment
- Training job submission
- Inference requests
- Result retrieval

### Coordination Layer
Manages distributed learning workflows:
- Federated aggregation
- Ensemble orchestration
- Device selection
- Round synchronization

### Security Layer
Ensures integrity and confidentiality:
- TEE-based execution
- Attestation generation
- Privacy preservation
- Encrypted communication

### Transport Layer
Handles device communication:
- Protocol adapters (MQTT, Modbus, OPC-UA)
- Message routing
- Network resilience
- Offline operation support

## Consensus Mechanism

Furcate uses **Proof of Authority (PoA)** for consensus among edge devices:

### Validator Requirements
- Devices must be pre-authenticated and verified
- Identity confirmation through organizational credentials
- Hardware attestation capability required
- Minimum computational resources met

### Validator Selection
- Reputation-based authority assignment
- Round-robin block generation
- No proof-of-work required
- Deterministic leader selection

### Advantages for Edge ML
- High transaction throughput (model updates)
- Low latency (sub-second consensus)
- Energy efficient (no mining)
- Resilient to Byzantine faults (51% tolerance)

## Message Format

All protocol messages use Protocol Buffers for efficiency:

```protobuf
message ModelUpdate {
  string device_id = 1;
  int64 timestamp = 2;
  bytes encrypted_gradients = 3;
  bytes signature = 4;
  AttestationReport attestation = 5;
}

message AggregationRequest {
  string round_id = 1;
  repeated string participant_ids = 2;
  int32 min_participants = 3;
  int64 deadline = 4;
}
```

See `schemas/messages.proto` for complete definitions.

## Security Model

### Threat Model
Furcate assumes:
- Network adversaries (eavesdropping, MITM)
- Compromised edge devices (malicious participants)
- Data poisoning attacks
- Model inversion attempts

### Defenses
1. **Encrypted Communication**: TLS 1.3 for all network traffic
2. **TEE Execution**: Computation in secure enclaves
3. **Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of correct execution
4. **Differential Privacy**: Statistical privacy guarantees
5. **Secure Aggregation**: No server access to individual updates
6. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Resilient to malicious participants

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Federated Factory Floor
```
PLCs/Sensors (Modbus) → Gateway → Furcate Network → Cloud (optional)
```

### Pattern 2: Smart Agriculture
```
IoT Sensors (LoRaWAN) → Edge Nodes → Federated Aggregation → Farm Insights
```

### Pattern 3: Smart City
```
Cameras/Sensors (MQTT) → Local Processing → Privacy-Preserving Aggregation
```

## Protocol Extensions

Furcate protocol is designed for extensibility:
- Custom aggregation algorithms
- New privacy mechanisms
- Additional transport protocols
- Blockchain integration (optional)

## Future Blockchain Integration

While not required, Furcate architecture allows future integration with blockchain networks (like Minima) for:
- Immutable audit logs
- Decentralized coordinator discovery
- Smart contract-based access control
- Tokenized incentive mechanisms

The protocol remains functional without blockchain, making it optional and not a dependency.

## Compliance

Furcate protocol designed to support:
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, right to erasure
- **CCPA**: Privacy by design, data sovereignty
- **ISO 9001**: Quality management, auditability
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection
- **Industry Standards**: IEC 62443 for industrial control systems

## Protocol Versioning

Furcate uses semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- MAJOR: Breaking protocol changes
- MINOR: Backward-compatible features
- PATCH: Bug fixes and clarifications

Current version: **1.0.0**

## Reference Implementation

This repository contains the protocol specification only. Reference implementations:
